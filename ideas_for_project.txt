Method 2 Create a Bluetooth environment to turn on and off device:
-> Essentially create an environment for elderly people to create an interactive system through their phone
-> Will use LED lights to sure that the device has been actively turned on/off
-> Will use the BLEAK and AIOHTTP library to create a simple demonstration
-> The nordic nRF52-DK will have a thermistor sensor that will send data to the BLEAK program
